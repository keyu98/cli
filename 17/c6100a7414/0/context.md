## User Prompts

### Prompt 1

we are running the e2e suite currently for any merge in main, it's failing right now so I'd like to add some alerting to slack for it. Can you help me add this?

### Prompt 2

I called it E2E_SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL

### Prompt 3

can you validate this is the latest version of the slack api action?

### Prompt 4

can we add this only triggers on main not when doing manual runs?

### Prompt 5

could we get the names of the checks that is failing? and link the commit?

### Prompt 6

This workflow doesn’t set explicit permissions for the GITHUB_TOKEN, so it may inherit broader default permissions than needed. Since the new notify-slack job only needs to read run metadata and send a webhook, consider setting minimal permissions (e.g., contents: read) at the workflow or job level to reduce blast radius if a step/action is compromised.

### Prompt 7

The Slack action is referenced by a version tag (slackapi/slack-github-action@v2.1.1). For supply-chain hardening, consider pinning third-party GitHub Actions to a full commit SHA (and optionally documenting the intended release/tag) so an upstream retag can’t change what runs in CI.
