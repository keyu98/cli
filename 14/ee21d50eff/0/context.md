## User Prompts

### Prompt 1

ok we're working on the pr some more.

better approach, only use in two situations:

pre-push before we merge trees
in entire doctor, with detection and pointers to run doctor

so we can remove it from the other places and just have it be done with what is invoked from the pre-push hook. it has to be done before we do the tree merge in the pre-push. 

then in the other places where a disconnected branch may cause unexpected behaviour, like missing checkpoints, briefly explain the situation to...

### Prompt 2

push it to the branch

### Prompt 3

open it in github

### Prompt 4

// isEmptyMetadataBranch returns true if the branch ref points to a commit with an empty tree.

review comment; This intentionally only checks the tip commit's tree. If someone had an empty orphan commit followed by a data commit, the tip wouldn't be empty and this wouldn't match — which is correct for the intended use case (the bug created a single empty orphan that's the tip). Worth a brief doc comment clarifying this only checks the tip, so future readers don't wonder about the multi-commi...

### Prompt 5

metadata_reconcile.go:128
Nit: ReconcileDisconnectedMetadataBranch creates its own context.Background() here, but callers like getBranchCheckpoints already have a ctx. Threading context through would allow cancellation to propagate and would be more idiomatic Go.
